# Getting Started with Create React App

Simple terminal based porfolio I am creating. It's essentially completed and I don't want to make it over-the-top.

##
I won't supply my porfolio as my resume, I trust that if a hiring manager is from a programming background they will likely checkout my Git repos, or even be curious enough to see that I have a custom email: contact@aaronc.xyz
