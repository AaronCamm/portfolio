# My Portfolio - https://aaronc.xyz

Simple terminal based porfolio I am creating in ReactJS. It's essentially completed and I don't want to make it over-the-top.

I will keep my completed web-projects here in their own sub-domain.

##
I won't supply my porfolio as my resume, I trust that if a hiring manager is from a programming background they will likely checkout my Git repos, or even be curious enough to see that I have a custom email: contact@aaronc.xyz

##
I might end up adding some easter eggs
